<p id="B">The bottom edge of the Apple iPod Touch (7th generation) houses a built-in speaker, Lightning port, and, puzzlingly, a 3.5mm headphone jack. Apple stopped including headphone jacks on its smartphones a long time ago in favor of its own multi-purpose Lightning port, with the last jack-friendly models, the iPhone 6S and iPhone SE, being discontinued in 2018.
    Weâ€™ve speculated as to why Apple would include a headphone jack on the new iPod, with possible explanations ranging from the superior audio quality provided by wired headphones to the theory that Apple is trying to appeal to children who may find wireless headphones fiddly and annoying to use.</p>
